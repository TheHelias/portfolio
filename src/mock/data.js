  paragraphOne: `
  I am a Full-stack engineer with 3 years of professional experience building web applications. `,
  paragraphTwo: `I consistently use React and some of its frameworks like Next and Gatsby for frontend
   development and NodeJs with express for backend development. I constantly use various databases like
    MongoDB, Postgresql, and Firestore. I am good with the agile method of software development with
     good experience using Trello and pivotal tracker amongst others.`,
  paragraphThree: `I am also a big fan of testing and collaborating using version control tools.
   I have good knowledge and experience using Netlify, Vercel, and Heroku amongst others for
    deploying applications. Of course, I use many other tools asides from the aforementioned
     which can't be contained here and I easily pick up new ones daily. I enjoy
      creating, learning and always love a good challenge.`,
  paragraphFour: `In 2017, I co-founded 
  a peer-to-peer learning community for developers where I functioned as a hands-on tutor. From there, 
  I went on to working various freelance and contract jobs with the notable one being Servicemart 
  - a startup where I worked as a Fullstack Engineer in a team of 3 to build their service
   listing and hiring platform. Later on, I went on to work at EpowerNg - a Web and App agency
    where I functioned as the Frontend Engineer for 9 months. I worked on many challenging and
     interesting projects there with the companyâ€™s clients. I currently work freelance and 
     I am very open to full-time opportunities.`,
